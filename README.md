# Task-1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
## ☕ Dirty Cafe Sales Cleanup

This repo is part of a basic data cleaning task using Python and Pandas.  
The dataset had missing values, inconsistent formats, and some messy entries — basically your usual real-world chaos.

## 🔍 What I Did

- Handled missing values (like Quantity, Price, Location, etc.)
- Removed odd or broken entries
- Fixed data types (e.g., Quantity as integer, proper datetime conversion)
- Cleaned up messy text (standardized item names, payment methods, etc.)
- Formatted dates and renamed columns for consistency
- Recalculated missing "Total Spent" values when needed
- Checked for duplicates (none found, but added the check anyway)
